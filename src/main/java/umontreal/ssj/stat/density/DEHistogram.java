/**
 * This class provides methods to construct, manipulate, and evaluate a
 * histogram density estimator for univariate densities.
 * 
 * The construction of a histogram is based on a set of \f$n\f$ individual
 * observations \f$X_0, â€¦, X_{n-1}\f$ which, in turn, can be realizations of a
 * \ref umontreal.ssj.mcqmctools.MonteCarloModelDouble, for instance. In any
 * case, this type of density estimator can by built from pure data stored in an
 * array, form a \ref umontreal.ssj.stat.TallyHistogram, or even from a \ref
 * umontreal.ssj.stat.ScaledHistogram.
 * 
 * 
 * It is essential to confine oneself to a finite interval \f$[a,b]\f$. For a
 * fixed number of bins \f$s>0\f$ we partition the interval \f$[a,b]\f$ into
 * \f$s\f$ subintervals of equal lengths \f$h\f$. Observe that \f$h=(b-a)/s\f$
 * and, hence, histogram estimators can also be parameterized by a bin width
 * \f$h>0\f$, as long as the resulting number of bins is an integer. The
 * estimator itself is then defined by
 * 
 * \f[ \hat{f}_{n}(x) = \hat{f}_{n,h}(x) = \frac{n_j}{nh},\quad\text{for }
 * x\in[a+(j-1)h, a+jh), \quad j=1,\dots,s, \f]
 * 
 * where \f$n_j\f$ denotes the number of observations that fall in this
 * interval. Observe that changing \f$[a,b]\f$, \f$h\f$, or \f$s\f$ changes the
 * structure of the histogram completely. Thus, after any alteration of these
 * parameters the histogram needs to be constructed afresh.
 * 
 * As histograms are constant within one bin certain quantities, such as the
 * variance, are not affected by shifting an evaluation point within its bin.
 * Hence, selecting one evaluation point per bin is sufficient for such methods.
 * To this end, this class provides methods to evaluate the density estimator
 * once in each bin, without having to explicitly specify an array of evaluation
 * points.
 * 
 * It needs to be added that, due to the fact that the partition into \f$s\f$
 * bins relies on half-open intervals, the boundary \f$b\f$ is not included in
 * any of these intervals. Since the probability of an observation being exactly
 * equal to \f$b\f$ is zero, we can effectively ignore this subtlety.
